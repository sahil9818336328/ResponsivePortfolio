            I'm a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day,
            experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, inhaling a wide
            variety of potentially usefull information through platforms like
            StackOverflow and medium.Iâ€™m curious, and I enjoy work that
            challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different
            direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of
            the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the
            job at hand. I build responsive websites that can be viewed from a
            smartphone, laptops & desktop and i do it very well.

            As a fresher I don't have any experience but i have been coding for
            2+ years building responsive web designs using technologies like
            Html, Css, JavaScript and learing developer tools for debugging.
            Soon i'll have this section filled with my experience .
